## **Things Annie has learned**

### (And all the things she hasn't and is absolutely confounded by) <sub>*[Not a comprehensive list]*</sub>
Okay! This isn't going to be sorted in any discernible order, but instead by my own internal organization system.

- Markdown looks remarkably simple at its core, and I will definitely be having fun with it in later files. 
- Images are a supported addition to files. I'm going to import so many silly images.
  - My profile picture: ![Single song jacket for "Kororon" by Eve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/478c36a1-a387-4eef-b4cd-20bfada61f78)
  - It's the song jacket for my favorite song: [**"Kororon" by Eve**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLXVIDm1ahg)
  - I recommend watching [the music video for Kororon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw96jPDtoDQ); all of Eve's music videos are really cool and expertly animated, but Kororon in particular is an absolute vibe
- Apparently HTML tags work for formatting as well? I was fighting the markdown at one point (It kept refusing to make `- (text)` into a list), and `<li></li>` worked to create a list term. So I guess it's good to know that the little I remember from my 8th grade CompSci class might actually be somewhat useful.
- I was playing around in my profile, and discovered that there's a status option a la Discord. Obviously, I had to make mine something alluding to rubber ducks.
- There's a lot of jargon for what I think essentially amounts to
  - Repositories store all of the files in a given project
  - Forks let you make changes to a copy of code you don't have access to and suggest your changes to the original code
  - Pulls basically do the same as forks but more collaborative
- What I grasped from the intro was that GitHub is meant to make collaboration easier through the extensive use of a history for any changes made to a project, along with the ability to alter code and test it without affecting the actual code.
- The log for changes is called "Blame", which is pretty funny.
